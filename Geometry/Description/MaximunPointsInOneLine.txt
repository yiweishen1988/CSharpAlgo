Given N point on a 2D plane as pair of (x, y) co-ordinates, we need to find maximum number of point which lie on the same line.

Examples:

Input : points[] = {-1, 1}, {0, 0}, {1, 1}, 
                    {2, 2}, {3, 3}, {3, 4} 
Output : 4
Then maximum number of point which lie on same
line are 4, those point are {0, 0}, {1, 1}, {2, 2},
{3, 3}
