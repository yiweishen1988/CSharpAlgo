Find Simple Closed Path for a given set of points. Given a set of points, connect the dots without crossing.

Input: points[] = {(0, 3), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4),
                   (0, 0), (1, 2), (3, 1}, {3, 3}};

Output: Connecting points in following order would
        not cause any crossing
       {(0, 0), (3, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3),
        (4, 4), (1, 2), (0, 3)}
