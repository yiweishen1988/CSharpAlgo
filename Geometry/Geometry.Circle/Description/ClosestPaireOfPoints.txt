Given an array of n points in the plane, and the problem is to find out the 
closest pair of points in the array. This problem arises in a number of applications. 
For example, in air-traffic control, you may want to monitor planes that come too close together, 
since this may indicate a possible collision. 
Recall the following formula for distance between two points p and q.
