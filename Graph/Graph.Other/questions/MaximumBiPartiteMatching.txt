Maximum Bipartite Matching
A matching in a Bipartite Graph is a set of the edges chosen in such a way that no two edges 
share an endpoint. A maximum matching is a matching of maximum size (maximum number of edges). 
In a maximum matching, if any edge is added to it, it is no longer a matching. 
There can be more than one maximum matchings for a given Bipartite Graph.
